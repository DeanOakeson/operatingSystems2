I WILL HAVE 8 REGEISTERS I THINK, I decide what to implement.

OVERLAP IS NOT ALLOWED. OUT OF BOUNDS IS NOT ALLOWED. errordump can throw back integers to indicate which case needs to be handled.

At the end of the programs run there needs to be a way to signal the os to clear the table.

THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ERROR MESSAGE FOR THE OUT OF BOUNDARY AND FOR THE OVERLAP. DO NOT RUN THE PROBLEM PROGRAMS ONLY RUN THE ONE WITH NO ERRORS.


Implement a program that adds a couple numbers together.

OS is boundry between software and hardware.
